        <h2>All About Beauty Of Nature</h2>
        <p>Nature can refer to the general realm of living beings, and in some cases to the processes associated
            with inanimate objects—the way that particular types of things exist and change of their own accord,
            such as the weather and geology of the Earth. It is often taken to mean the "natural environment" or
            wilderness—wild animals, rocks, forest, and in general those things that have not been substantially
            altered by human intervention, or which persist despite human intervention. For example, manufactured
            objects and human interaction generally are not considered part of nature, unless qualified as, for
            example, "human nature" or "the whole of nature". This more traditional concept of natural things that can
            still be found today implies a distinction between the natural and the artificial, with the artificial being
            understood as that which has been brought into being by a human consciousness or a human mind. Depending on
            the particular context, the term "natural" might also be distinguished from the unnatural or the
            supernatural </p>

        <h2>Nature</h2>
        <p>Nature is a common notion, which everyone is familiar with as long as we are not asked to define it. This is
            normal: there is no consensus definition of it, and the term is rejected by most academic disciplines in
            both the sciences and the humanities. Yet it stays, and even better: it is eminently political – and even
            more so at a time when the idea of “protecting nature” is pressing. In this article, we attempt to unravel
            its mysteries, tracing its origin, its evolution and the succession of issues in which it has found itself
            in a central position. The aim is to identify the different realities it embraces, and the particular ways
            in which we relate to them in the era of global crises.</p>

            quite easy. With just a few small lifestyle changes, you can protect the planet while creating a healthier
            life for yourself and future generations. A single household or individual can make a big difference: the
